# Laser Maze Rules

Laser Maze is a single-player logic puzzle game by ThinkFun where players arrange tokens on a grid to direct a laser beam to illuminate target pieces.

## Components

- 5x5 game grid with challenge card slot
- 1 Laser token (beam source with push-button activation)
- 5 Target/Mirror tokens
- 2 Beam Splitter tokens
- 1 Double-Mirror token
- 1 Checkpoint token
- 1 Cell Blocker token
- 60 Challenge cards (with solutions on reverse)
- Symbols Key Card

## Token Types

### Laser
The beam source. Press the button to activate the laser. The beam emits in one direction.

### Target/Mirror
Dual-function token. One side is a transparent red target that lights up when hit by the beam. The mirror side reflects the beam at a 90-degree angle. Only the red transparent side counts as a valid target hit.

### Beam Splitter
Splits the laser beam into two paths. One path reflects 90 degrees while the other passes straight through the token.

### Double-Mirror
Has reflective surfaces on both sides. Each side reflects the beam at a 90-degree angle.

### Checkpoint
The laser beam must pass through this token to complete the challenge. The beam passes straight through without changing direction.

### Cell Blocker
Occupies a grid cell to prevent other tokens from being placed there. Does not block or affect the laser beam path.

## How to Play

1. Select a challenge card and place it in the grid's card slot
2. Set up the starting tokens as shown on the challenge card illustration
3. Tokens marked with a question mark (?) must be placed but their orientation is unknown - you must figure out the correct direction
4. Add the additional tokens listed on the card to the grid
5. Press the laser button to activate the beam
6. Solve the puzzle by arranging tokens so the beam:
   - Lights up the required number of targets shown on the card
   - Passes through any checkpoint tokens indicated

## Winning

A challenge is solved when:
- The correct number of targets are illuminated
- The beam passes through all required checkpoints
- Each challenge has exactly one correct solution (flip the card to verify)

## Difficulty Levels

The 60 challenges are divided into four difficulty levels:
- **Beginner** (15 challenges): Most token positions and orientations provided
- **Intermediate** (15 challenges): Some orientations unknown
- **Advanced** (15 challenges): Fewer starting positions given
- **Expert** (15 challenges): Minimal hints, must determine most placements independently

## Laser Beam Behavior

- Travels in a straight line until it hits a token or exits the grid
- Reflects 90 degrees when hitting a mirror surface
- Splits into two beams when passing through a beam splitter
- Passes through checkpoints without changing direction
- Illuminates targets when hitting the transparent red side
